# [TODO][NERLA]: Audit Log has been signed by enclave, use it for the BulletinBoard
# Requesting the auditlog is implemented as a seperate lightweight ecall that doesn't change the enclave state 
# auditlogPVRA ecall currently does not use audit_version_no, instead it just dumps the entire audit log (we can change later this doesn't seem high priority)
# the "blob" that is signed is {hash(eCMD0) || cmd0_userpubkey || ... || hash(eCMDN) || cmdN_userpubkey}
# there are print statements in the ecall for a better look
